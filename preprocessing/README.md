# Install

This project uses tensorflow within a Docker container to train the models. 
For the data preprocessing and result postprocessing, the conda environment is provided in `environment.yml`. 
The conda environment can be installed by running `conda env create` from the repo root directory. 

## Prerequisites

The model training setup needs the following:

- docker
- docker-compose
- Tensorflow Docker: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker
- Nvidia docker: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/blob/master/README.md#quickstart

## Setup
1. Clone the repo 
2. Copy and change `mfm.env.template` to `mfm.env` and change the UID to match your user id. You can see your user id by typing 
```
id
```
2. Run
```
docker-compose build
```
To build the docker container. You should only have to do this once. 

3. To start the container, run 
```
docker-compose up -d
```

To start a terminal in the docker container, type `./start_terminal.sh`. 

# Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing scripts for CTU-UHB and Penn cohorts are in `preprocessing/`. 

## CTU-UHB 

To generate the CTU-UHB training and test sets, first download the database from [physionet](https://physionet.org/content/ctu-uhb-ctgdb/1.0.0/).
Then navigate to `preprocessing/CTU` and run

```
python preprocess_data.py --data_dir {path-to-ctu-data}
```

# Model Training  

Models are defined in the `methods/` folder and trained using `train_models.py`. 

Type `python train_models.py -h` to see how it is used. 
As an example, the following would train and test a CNN multiscale classifier on the CTU data in `data/CTU`, using a random seed of 42, training on GPU 0, with a classification pH threshold of 7.05, batch size of 128, using data samples preprocessed (see above) to have one hour of tracings with up to 30% missingness and a sample rate of 0.25 Hz and lab order results available within 30 minutes of the end of the trace: 

```
python train_models.py run \
    --datadir data/CTU \
    --ml CNN_multiscale_classification_maxpool \
    --random_state 42 \
    --gpu 0 \
    --savedir results \
    --threshold 7.05 \
    --window 60 \
    --missingness 0.3 \
    --batch_size 128 \
    --sample_rate 0.25 \
    --lab_order_delay 30
```
